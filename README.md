# Diecast-Timer-Start-gate-System
Inspired by 3DBotmaker simple sketch for a timer and start gate system for diecast racing.

## Description
This is a sketch I use to run a sensor/timer display, start lights and a start gate for my diecast hot wheels track. I'm using an Arduino Uno with basic parts that come from an arduino kit.
